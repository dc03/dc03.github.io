  This week, I had mainly spent my time trying out various little experiments to see if any of them made a difference on
  performance. Even though I got no real results out of it, I was trying to get more accomodated with the codebase and
  I learned a lot from it!
</p>
<p>
  I also spent time on <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/33910">issue #33910</a>, and I was able to
  get the code to run 50% faster just with one word and one comma added!
</p>
<p>
  Here are the various experiments that I tried:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Only insert nodes in <code>PruningList</code> when <code>use_empty()</code> in <code>AddUsersToWorklist</code> and
      <code>AddToWorklistWithUsers</code>

      <p>
        My first attempt was at building off of the work that I had done last week, where I introduced a new parameter
        <code>IsCandidateForPruning</code> to reduce the number of <code>PruningList</code> insertions that were done.
        However, it seems like that patch already did pretty much all the work with regards to speeding up the pruning
        list, and I only saw a tiny improvement to performance, so small that I didn't bother checking it on the compile
        time tracker.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still believe there is performance to be gained here, I just don't know how much. I'm assuming its not a lot.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Change <code>DenseMap</code> to use <code>constexpr</code> for <code>shouldReverseIterate</code>

      <p>
        This change was me taking a shot in the dark, just throwing things at the wall and trying to see if something
        stuck. In this case, I naively assumed that the compiler would somehow not be able to optimize one line of code
        whose values are known at compile time and all required function definitions are visible into an if statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        As expected, this change did not net anything at all.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Change <code>DenseMap</code> to use Fibonacci Hashing

      <p>
        This one was a little silly, to be honest. <code>DenseMap</code> currently uses quadratic probing to locate
        keys, and I wanted to try a different form of hashing to see the performance differences.
        <a href="https://probablydance.com/2018/06/16/fibonacci-hashing-the-optimization-that-the-world-forgot-or-a-better-alternative-to-integer-modulo/">
          Fibonacci Hashing
        </a>
        is a form of hashing which seemed quite promising at first to me. However, I either implemented it incorrectly
        or quadratic probing is already good enough (I suspect it is the former), as I did not see any improvements when
        I used Fibonacci hashing, and infact the performance slightly regressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing which made it quite difficult for me to test small changes properly was the fact that changing any
        part of that header would lead to recompiling pretty much every other file in the project. This is really quite
        offputting, but I'm still interested in this change and might come back to it later.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Disable the first call to <code>DAGCombiner</code> (curiosity's sake)

      <p>
        This change was just for fun. I wanted to see what would happen if I diasbled one of the calls to
        <code>DAGCombiner::Run</code> in <code>SelectionDAG</code>. As expected, it led to many test failures.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Call <code>.insert()</code> with range on <code>Set</code> and <code>.clear()</code> on <code>Vector</code> in
      <code>SmallSet::insert</code>

      <p>
        This was part of the changes I was making to try and make the <code>PruningList</code> in
        <code>DAGCombiner</code> run faster. I assumed that the set operations were slow (correct), but then I assumed
        that <code>SmallSetVector</code> used <code>SmallSet</code> (wrong). It actually uses
        <code>SmallDenseSet</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I actually did expect this to make a difference though, no matter how minor. I assumed that calling the batch
        operations on <code>Set</code> and <code>Vector</code> would be faster (which they are), but I didn't realize
        that these operations are only called once in the entire set's lifetime, which is when it is expanding from the
        "small" to the "large" representation. :facepalm:
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Change <code>Worklist</code> and <code>PruningList</code> small size to 128 in <code>DAGCombiner</code>

      <p>
        This was another silly change. I assumed that increasing the small size would lead to better performance, but I
        didn't realize that the small size was in terms of number of elements, not in terms of number of bytes. So this
        actually led to my cache getting thrashed and my performance getting slashed, as the small representation uses
        a linear search, which is great at small sizes but awful with larger sizes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Change <code>while (!CallSUnits.empty())</code> to range-based for loop in <code>BuildSchedUnits</code>

      <p>
        This loop is present at the end of the function <code>ScheduleDAGSDNodes::BuildSchedUnits</code>. This is also
        a function that I see taking up a lot of time, so I thought that changing this from the usual worklist-style 
        loop to a normal one would lead to some performance gain, but either I guessed wrong about how many times this
        part of the code executes or how much time the constituent computations actually take.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is probably a combination of both, <code>SmallVector</code> operations are very cheap in the small
        representation and that loop is not run many times. The reason I know this is that changing the small size of
        <code>CallSUnits</code> did not affect the runtime, and in fact led to a slight regression in performance.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  To be honest, these experiments were really quite helpful to me. While quite demoralizing, they helped me better
  understand how the LLVM data structures work and also how to use KCacheGrind more properly in terms of analyzing the
  emitted machine code and the source code.
</p>
<p>
  These experiments also helped me run an experiment which gave unexpectedly good results, this I will cover in the post
  for next week.
</p>
<p>
  Regarding issue #33910, the reason for the <code>isKeyOf</code> operation being so slow was not because of the
  ordering of the comparisons within it but instead because of the number of times it was called. I should have expected
  that some <code>&&</code>s and <code>==</code>s would not have had a meaningful difference on performance, and instead
  it would've been a much better idea to reduce the number of times that function is called.
</p>
<p>
  This was something I realized when I actually dove into the issue and measured the various equality operators and how
  often they were inequal. This gave a very interesting result: the comparisons were pretty much dominated by 
  differences between the <code>OffsetInBits</code> metadata, and it was about 60x more likely to be inequal on average:

  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="assets/GSoC Week 4 - performance.png" class="image-content">
  </div>
</p>
<p>
  Note that this is not even the full data generated, I stopped it when it had roughly as many rows as there are
  <code>OffsetInBits</code> inequalities, because at that point I had 1.2GiB of data and not enough RAM to load it all
  at once.
</p>
<p>
  When I brought this up with my mentor, they told me that this is probably the cause of the quadratic behaviour, as
  the <code>getHashValue</code> function for <code>DIDerivedType</code> did not take into account the
  <code>OffsetInBits</code> parameter. The reason for so many inequalities was because the file provided by the
  issue (at least for the small case) has pretty much 20,000 lines of metadata with exactly two unique names:
  <code>Va</code> and <code>Vb</code>, with only the <code>OffsetInBits</code> differing between them. This hit the
  corner case of not including that value in the hash function, which caused an explosion in the collision chains and
  thus caused the compile time explosion.
</p>
<p>
  As expected, changing the hash function to take <code>OffsetInBits</code> into account led to a huge reduction in
  compile time, from roughly 8 seconds to 4.3 seconds. This pretty much erased <code>isKeyOf</code> from the flamegraph,
  and the only bottleneck now is <code>ReplaceableMetadataImpl::replaceAllUsesWith</code>, which requires uniquing all
  metadata all over again each time it is called. This is extremely slow, and it makes sense to only unique things after
  the whole file is parsed.
</p>
<p>
  As per my GSoC proposal, I was actually supposed to work on this during the midterm eval,
  so I will be pushing fixing this issue back while I focus on non-edge cases. I think the solution is simple enough
  that postponing it will be fine.
