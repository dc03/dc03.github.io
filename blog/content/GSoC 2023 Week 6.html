  This week, I spent most of my time just analyzing code. I was digging mainly through profiles of
  <code>RegAllocGreedy</code>, and I was trying to find areas to improve. While I wasn't able to do much in general, I
  was able to get one useful patch out of it:
  <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D152781">https://reviews.llvm.org/D152781</a>.

  While going through the profiles, I noticed that a fair bit of time was being spent in the function
  <code>BlockFrequency::operator+=</code>. I initially tried to see if I could optimize it, but there was not much to be
  done there. Then I noticed that it wasn't being inlined, so I asked around and got to know that LLVM in general is not
  built using LTO. As this function is called quite a lot, such a simple thing not being inlined led to an
  unnecessary overhead. By moving this method into the header so that it could be inlined everywhere, a

  was gained.

  I also tried a few other experiments, which led to no useful gains:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7b84d0b58d8b67fdc46c0aebede53ab010ce6be7">Trying to speed up
        <code>BitVector::reference::operator=</code></a> - I noticed that this function was using a branch where it
      wasn't necessary, however its probably not used often enough to matter.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/2855324dbf886bd67502c59af1bd2edc4d1079c8">Replacing
        <code>array_pod_sort</code> with <code>std::sort</code></a> - <code>array_pod_sort</code> is used in the LLVM
      codebase as it is not a template and instead uses <code>qsort</code> as its sorting algorithm. This gives a good
      binary size reduction as it reduces bloat caused by template instantiations. However, <code>std::sort</code> is
      a fair bit faster, and it gave a meaningful improvement in this case but not enough to warrant a patch.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/89e8e31e38c3b767b237accecad58f148ca007a1">Changing a couple
        of container sizes</a> - This is my favourite kind of experiment, cause it is super easy and usually gives
      results. In this case, making the containers' small sizes just a bit bigger gives a slightly measurable result
      though it is actually not really distinguishable from noise.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/63f623f6a735f41186db1adcc94a695b5ab33bae">Adding
        <code>LLVM_LIKELY</code> and <code>LLVM_UNLIKELY</code></a> - I didn't expect this to have any real results, and
      it didn't. I noticed that a fair number of jumps were being taken when the condition was false on these
      conditions, which could have led to an issue with jumping to instructions which are out of cache. However, there
      is no such issue in reality because the jumps are likely too small to matter, so there was no measurable
      difference.
    </li>
  </ul>

  I also looked for a long time into <code>RegAllocFast</code>, however it is a very small file and very well optimized,
  so I couldn't find anything to optimize in there. Similarly, <code>FastISel</code> also didn't seem to have too much
  to optimize in it either, though I did certainly try :).
