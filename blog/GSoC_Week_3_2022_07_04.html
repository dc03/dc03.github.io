                <p>This blog post is related to my <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/BrXiUNA2">GSoC 2022
project</a>.
<br>
<p>
This week, I worked on Part I of my GSoC project, i.e. the buffer functions. In this time I refactored most of the functions,
and found out how to make them conform to how it works in GameMaker Studio (GMS).
</p>
<p>
Firstly, to make serialization and deserialization of data more consistent and easy to refactor, I
<a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2309/commits/24c252a196fbb4ede994dd635b19a50f53a11345">implemented two functions</a>
to do the job: <code>serialize_to_type()</code> and <code>deserialize_from_type()</code>.
<br><br>
These two functions are pretty simple:
<ul>
<li><code>serialize_to_type()</code>: takes a <code>variant</code>, the type it is storing, and serializes it as a vector
of bytes. For integers, the serialization is done in big endian form, where the most significant byte of the integer comes
first in the stream, and the least significant byte comes last.
<br><br>
There is also an interesting issue here: as all numeric values in ENIGMA are stored as <code>double</code>s, large values of signed and
unsigned integers have to be deserialized specially. Before <a href="https://github.com/enigma-dev/enigma-dev/pull/2309/commits/2e83034865225044380b0bc60e07e5cb351e7873">commit #2e8303486</a>,
the value stored in <code>rval.d</code> was converted to a signed integer, always. However, the problem lies in that when converting
from a double to a signed integer, the top bit of the integer is reserved for the sign bit of the double. This causes an
issue where unsigned values greater than the signed maximum value (which have the topmost bit set) get divided by half when
converting to signed integers as that top bit is reserved for the sign bit.
<br><br>
The fix is fairly straightforward: check if <code>rval.d</code> is greater than the signed maximum value, and if so, convert
to unsigned instead. This does not cause any issues, as <code>rval.d</code> will only be greater than the maximum value 
if an unsigned value is stored, whereas a signed integer would wrap around to a negative value and then <code>rval.d</code>
would be less than the maximum value.
<br><br>
Unlike GMS, both <code>buffer_string</code> and <code>buffer_text</code> are treated as being equivalent, where both consist of a stream
of characters terminated by a null terminator. In GMS, only <code>buffer_text</code> is null-terminated.
</li>
<li><code>deserialize_from_type()</code>: takes a pair of <code>std::vector&lt;std::byte&gt;::iterator</code>s and the type being converted
to, and returns a <code>variant</code> containing the deserialized value. Checks if the pair of iterators exactly represent
the type being deserialized.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After this, I did some refactoring, where I renamed the macros <code>get_buffer</code> and <code>get_bufferr</code> to
<code>GET_BUFFER</code> and <code>GET_BUFFER_R</code> respectively. These are the macros used to access buffers, and in
debug mode, they are responsible for checking if the buffer being accessed actually exists. Then, I changed the global
<code>enigma::buffers</code> variable to be a <code>AssetArray&lt;BinaryBufferAsset&gt;</code> instead of a
<code>std::vector&lt;BinaryBuffer*&gt;</code>.
<br><br>
<code>AssetArray</code> is effectively to ENIGMA what <code>std::vector</code> is to the C++ standard library. It allows
making a container of assets, which require three methods to be implemented:
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">getAssetTypeName()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">isDestroyed()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">destroy()</span></li>
</ul>
These methods make it possible to delete elements from the sequence without having to use the erase-remove idiom, which
can be quite slow as it is O(n) in terms of time complexity. To implement these methods without changing the <code>BinaryBuffer</code>
class, I created the <code>BinaryBufferAsset</code> class. This class simply wraps a <code>BinaryBuffer</code> inside a
<code>std::unique_ptr</code>, and the methods manipulate the smart pointer. The <code>nullptr</code> value is considered
as the <code>BinaryBuffer</code> within being "destroyed".
</p>
<p>
I also gave types to three of the enums which are used for the bufer constants:
<ul>
<li><code>buffer_data_t</code>: this stores the various data types which the buffer can store, like <code>buffer_u8</code>,
<code>buffer_u16</code>, <code>buffer_string</code> and so on.
</li>
<li><code>buffer_seek_t</code>: this stores the three ways in which a buffer's can seek to a position, namely <code>buffer_seek_start</code>,
<code>buffer_seek_relative</code> and <code>buffer_seek_end</code>.
</li>
<li><code>buffer_type_t</code>: this stores the type of the buffer itself, i.e. how it behaves when it comes to accessing data
and resizing itself. This enum consists of <code>buffer_grow</code>, <code>buffer_wrap</code>, <code>buffer_fixed</code> and
<code>buffer_fast</code>. The constant <code>buffer_vbuffer</code> is currently not stored in this enum.
</ul>
Previously, all these values were just passed around as standard integers. The problem with this was that you could pass
the wrong type of value to a function and there would be no error as the enum value would be implicitly cast to an int.
In fact, it was possible to not even realize that there was an error, as the erroneous value could have had the same
integer value as the correct type of value.
</p>
<p>
After that, I added the ability to have sub-directories of tests within the <code>SimpleTests/</code> directory. Previously,
the test harness would only check for directories ending with <code>.sog</code> in the top level directory. However, as I
have decided to make the tests for each buffer function its own separate test, having it all in the main tests directory would
lead to more crowding and would make it harder to navigate through the tests. Therefore, when the test harness finds a directory
ending with the <code>.multi</code> extension, it considers all the directories within that directory as tests too. This means
that I can group all the buffer tests, each of which begin with the "buffer_" prefix into the <code>buffers.multi</code>
sub-directory.
</p>
<p>
Finally, after having set all this up, I began work on the buffer functions themselves. The problems here did not come from
the implementation being complex (in fact the functions are quite trivial in terms of functionality), they came from wanting
to conform with how GMS works so that transitioning from it to ENIGMA would be easier.
<br><br>
So, a quick changelog of each function:
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_exists()</span>: no noteworthy changes
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_create()</span>: refactor into a call to <code>make_new_buffer</code>, which deals with <code>AssetArray</code>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_delete()</span>: use <code>AssetArray</code>'s "destroy()" method
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_read()</span>: align to buffer's alignment before reading
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_write()</span>: align to buffer's alignment before writing
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_fill()</span>: make it not completely broken, align to buffer's alignment before writing
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_seek()</span>: seek to <code>GetSize() - 1 + offset</code> when using <code>buffer_seek_end</code>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_tell()</span>: no noteworthy changes
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_peek()</span>: use <code>deserialize_from_type</code>, read integral types as <code>double</code> instead of <code>long</code>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_poke()</span>: add flag to control automatic resizing of <code>buffer_grow</code>, refactor into a call to <code>write_to_buffer()</code>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_load()</span>: make it not completely broken, switch to a call to <code>std::transform</code> instead of <code>std::ifstream::read</code>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_load_ext()</span>:  switch to a call to <code>std::transform</code> instead of <code>std::ifstream::read</code>, refactor into a call to <code>write_to_buffer()</code>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_get_type()</span>: no noteworthy changes
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_get_alignment()</span>: no noteworthy changes
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_get_address()</span>: no noteworthy changes
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_get_size()</span>: no noteworthy changes
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_resize()</span>: no noteworthy changes
</li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_sizeof()</span>: no noteworthy changes
</li>
</ul>
Out of all of these, <code>buffer_fill()</code> has caused the most pain till now. While not really difficult to implement,
getting it to conform (mostly) with GMS's implementation was not fun. In fact, I have had 6 commits till now, updating it
whenever I find a new edge case and test it in GMS to make sure my implementation conforms properly.
<br><br>
I think the reason that I have been having these issues is mainly because of buffer alignment and how I think about it
versus how GMS thinks about it. Initially, I implemented buffer alignment by adding padding bytes after the written data,
so that the next element being written was always aligned.
<br><br>
What is interesting is that GMS does the opposite: it writes
padding bytes until the data being written would be aligned, and only then does it write the data itself. This means that
instead of writing padding for the next element, GMS writes padding for the current element. Logically, it makes more sense
as it uses less space, however it was confusing when I first encountered it when seeing <code>buffer_fill()</code> not write
zeroes after it wrote data to a buffer.
<br><br>
I have tried to validate the way these functions work as much as I can, by running GMS inside a Windows VM to test how the
reference implementation works, and also by writing as many tests as I can under the <code>buffers.multi</code> group. Hopefully,
these tests cover enough edge cases so that the buffer functions work properly in normal use. The functions currently remaining
for refactoring are:
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_save()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_save_ext()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_copy()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_get_surface()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_set_surface()</span></li>
</ul>
The functions currently not implemented at all are:
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_create_from_vertex_buffer()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_create_from_vertex_buffer_ext()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_save_async()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_load_async()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_load_partial()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_compress()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_decompress()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_async_group_begin()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_async_group_option()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_async_group_end()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_copy_from_vertex_buffer()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_md5()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_sha1()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_crc32()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_base64_encode()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_base64_decode()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_base64_decode_ext()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_set_used_size()</span></li>
</ul>
Of these, the ones I will definitely implement are:
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_compress()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_decompress()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_md5()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_sha1()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_crc32()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_base64_encode()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_base64_decode()</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#F87A32;">buffer_base64_decode_ext()</span></li>
</ul>
I am also interested in <code>buffer_load_partial()</code> and <code>buffer_set_used_size()</code>. Hopefully, I can finish
these functions this week, and get back to working on the EDL parser, so that I can have as much time as possible to work on
Part II of my GSoC project before college begins.

<p><b>Incompatibilities with GMS</b>:
<ul>
<li><code>buffer_text</code>: not null-terminated, considered equivalent to <code>buffer_string</code>
</li>
<li><code>buffer_grow</code>: GMS resizes by multiplying previous size by 2, ENIGMA resizes by adding +1 to previous size
</li>
<li><code>buffer_get_size()</code>: GMS does not store any extra bytes, ENIGMA always has an extra byte at the end where
the next byte will be written because of how <code>BinaryBuffer::Seek()</code> works
</li>
<li><code>buffer_poke()</code>: resizes <code>buffer_grow</code> when <code>resize</code> flag passed
</li>
<li><code>buffer_save()</code>: saves the whole buffer, instead of GMS which seems to only save the buffer up to the point
where the last byte was written
</li>
</ul>
