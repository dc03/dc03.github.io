## Hi, my name is Dhruv Chawla.

I am a student of the 2020 batch of Information Technology at the Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I primarily write programs using C++, C and Python, though I have experimented with other languages such as Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Haskell, Scheme, PHP, Assembly (x86_64) and Rust.

My hobbies include browsing HackerNews for interesting articles, playing games like CS:GO and binging too many videos on YouTube. I am currently learning about the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and am working on my own C compiler (not public yet).

I have worked on a few projects over the past couple of years, they are:

- [`nyx`][nyx-link]: a simple, deterministic and statically-typed interpreted language built from the ground-up using C++

- [`matty`][matty-link]: an optionally (on x86) SIMD accelerated matrix math library

- [`BitArray`][bitarray-link]: a small, single-header C++ library made to implement an array of bits, mostly to learn how to document C++ code

- [`rispy`][rispy-link]: a simple lispy-like lisp dialect created to practice the Rust language

- [`mini-utf8`][mini-utf8-link]: a little C library for encoding and decoding UTF-8 strings to understand how UTF-8 works under the hood

- [`tipy`][tipy-link]: a tiny interpreter I wrote for a toy language in an afternoon using Python

- [`bf.py`][bf.py-link]: a brainfuck interpreter written in a single line / 972 characters of Python

- [`asmfuck`][asmfuck-link]: a brainfuck interpreter written in x64 asm, for fun

- [`mkcproj`][mkcproj-link]: a small, simple bash script to automatically generate a C or C++ CMake project

- [`Small OpenGL Clock`][small-opengl-clock-link]: an xclock-like application made to practice OpenGL on Windows using Visual Studio 2019
