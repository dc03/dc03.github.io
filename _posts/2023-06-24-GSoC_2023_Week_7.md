This blog post is related to my
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/JdqGUwNq">GSoC
2023 Project</a>.

This week, I spent most of my time on `FastISel` and `VarLocBasedLDV`. In the process, I learnt
that `FastISel` is in fact, as the name implies, quite "fast". I also tried to optimize
`VarLocBasedLDV`, however I fell into a derp-induced optimization which gave me the wrong confidence that I
had actually found a good improvement :D.

So, with `FastISel` I tried a few optimizations I thought would have good potential:

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/73cacbde365185407f6e2f4bf78d4b3965d3be43">Remove
  `toIndex_` as a member of `IndexedMap`</a> - This is a commit that I feel I should still
  check the validity of, as even though it didn't give any useful performance improvements, it still removes an
  unnecessary member from a container which may have benefits in terms of memory usage. I found it a bit odd that
  the functor to map the index was instantiated as a non-static member, as the functor is usually constructed as a
  temporary object in `std::` functions.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7101a4251e82eac0cae997d206b5ce8c109d9973">Give
  `MapVector` better performance for small sizes</a> - This is one I definitely expected to have really
  good results. Maybe I didn't replace enough uses, but I expected this change to have an impact as it is basically
  the same thing I did for `SetVector` just applied to `MapVector`. Maybe the requirement of
  it being a map instead of a set has weird memory performance due to gaps between keys caused by the values, but
  I don't know. I feel I should come back to this optimization, because I really do feel there is performance to be
  gained here.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/1656cf790770585b4d3ef7dd6e15b185cabb5e82">Replace usages of
  `MapVector` with `SmallMapVector`</a> - A follow-up to the previous change, unfortunately
  measurable improvements :(.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/34a0e886a7ee8acced95929dd4a54eba8c96705e">Replace 
  `DenseMap` with `SmallDenseMap`</a> - I expected this to improve performance, but for some
  reason it didn't. I have noticed that generally replacing the small versions of `DenseMap` and
  `DenseSet` with the generic large versions gives better performance, but I have no idea why.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/fd41b84b2ff5f816cb250ba73d51afcaed54e130">Replace usages
  of `MapVector` with `SmallMapVector` in clang</a>  - Same thing as before, just in clang.
  No measurable difference unfortunately.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a7fec498831109fc4603c4e5ac53daf9c6634344">Reduce the number
  of branches in `ScheduleDAGSDNodes`</a> - A bit of a detour from the `FastISel` stuff, for
  some reason I committed it under the same branch. Not much measurable results here either, sadly.

I also got a good few experiments out of `VarLocBasedLDV`, however I haven't hammered them into something
useful yet:

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/9a1d7a2468f69891caab3636eee61237771bd257">Make
  `CoalescingBitVector` movable again</a> - This change reverts a change done by a previous patch:
  <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D76465">https://reviews.llvm.org/D76465</a>. This patch removed the move
  constructors, and I'm not really sure why. So, I added them back and removed the unnecessary
  `std::unique_ptr` in the type alias `VarLocInMBB`. This gave a noise-equivalent speedup, but
  I think its still worth pursuing for memory reasons.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/6e0b85f9c6387ff1d8418dd250010eaffcaddb7f">Messing around with
  data structures</a> - As I said before, this is one of the things I like doing most. However, in this case it
  actually leads to a major slow down,
  <a href="https://llvm-compile-time-tracker.com/compare.php?from=9a1d7a2468f69891caab3636eee61237771bd257&to=6e0b85f9c6387ff1d8418dd250010eaffcaddb7f&stat=instructions:u">~0.3%</a>.
  That is not good.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/284153009a86ef108fb99fed98d953eea8c2083a">"Optimize"
  `collectIDsForRegs`</a> - "Optimize" is in quotes there, because I didn't realize at the time that I
  was removing an iteration over the sorted collection from the for-loop. I did that, then forgot about it, then
  removed the sort entirely from the function because I only saw a use in taking the `front()` element.
  Not my brightest moment.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/92d43c792b98942e000b8d1325c72353761e8796">Replace
  `std::vector` with `SmallVector`</a> - I noticed that this gave a gain locally,
  unfortunately this gain was not visible on the compile time tracker. In general, `SmallVector` is
  supposed to be better than `std::vector`, because it does less work regarding exception handling among
  other things.

- <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/01a57bb4e81c86869c93601f3bd2e2b1a5442023">Remove a redundant
  two-time lookup</a> - This was pointed out to me by my mentor, and it does have a bit of an impact however its
  not enough to really warrant a patch. I will probably commit this as an NFC later on.

So, those were all the experiments I did this week. There were quite a few of them, unfortunately none of them panned
out the way I wanted them to. However, I do feel there are a few of them that should still be looked into further, and
I will probably do so.
