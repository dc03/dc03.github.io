This blog post is related to my [GSoC 2023 Project][project-link].

I landed these patches in week 15:

- [`[InstCombine] Remove unneeded isa<PHINode> check in foldOpIntoPhi`][phab-link-1]

- [`[InstCombine] Test case for D155718`][phab-link-2]

- [`[NFC][TLI] Replace std::lower_bound call in getLibFunc with DenseMap lookup`][phab-link-3]

- [`[NFC][ValueTracking] Remove calls to computeKnownBits for non-intrinsic CallInsts in isKnownNonZeroFromOperator`][phab-link-4]

In week 16, I mostly worked on finishing up the tests for the `InferAlignment` pass, in [`D158530`][phab-link-5]. These
have just been taking their sweet time as I've been working on getting a reduced set of test cases, which covers the
functionality without being excessively verbose like before. I also rearranged the patches so that the tests come first,
then the `InferAlignment` pass implementation, then the changes to `InstCombine`, and finally enabling the pass by
default. This involves the use of a `cl::opt` with a default value. Thus, the current order of patches is:

- [`[InferAlignment] Create tests for InferAlignment pass`][phab-link-5]

- [`[InferAlignment] Implement InferAlignmentPass`][phab-link-6]

- [`[InstCombine] Add a cl::opt to control calls to getOrEnforceKnownAlignment in LoadInst and StoreInst`][phab-link-7]

- [`[InferAlignment] Enable InferAlignment pass by default`][phab-link-8]
